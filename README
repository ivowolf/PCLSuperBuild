This is a clone of the PCLSuperBuild repository on gitorious 
(https://gitorious.org/pclsuperbuild/pclsuperbuild/) with 
some patches for windows. Currently, it seems to work for
MSVC2012 x64 (but it has not been intensively tested yet!!).

Currently, this project tries to build PCL version 1.7.2.

If you get an error in openni\include\XnPlatform.h that it
versions above 2010 are not supported: simply change the line
#if _MSC_VER > 1600 
to
#if _MSC_VER > 1700

To use this cmake project:

1) Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ivowolf/PCLSuperBuild.git PCLSuperBuild
2) Use CMake to configure the build
3) Build PCL and its requisites
